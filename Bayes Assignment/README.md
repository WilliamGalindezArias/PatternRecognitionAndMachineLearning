In this lab we will implement an OCR system. For simplicity we assume the texts contain only two letters: A and C, and that the letters are already well segmented into 10Ã—10 pixel image chips. We will extract a simple feature from the image chips and use it in a bayesian decision framework to partition the image set. Furthermore, the relative frequency of occurrence of A and C in text is given. We will consider two cases: (1) the measurements are discrete, and (2) the measurements are continuous.

In the discrete probabilities case, we will find the optimal strategy, compute its Bayesian risk, experiment with the loss function and classify independent data samples by applying the theory from the lecture slides directly.

In the continuous measurements case, an assumption is made that the extracted feature for each letter class (A,C) is generated by a normal distribution. The 'zero-one' loss will be used to estimate risk, which simplifies the decision strategy.
