At this week's labs we will implement the AdaBoost algorithm. The AdaBoost algorithm takes a class of “weak” classifiers and boosts their performance by combining them together to a “strong” classifier with adaptive weights assigned to each of the weak classifiers (AdaBoost stands for “adaptive boosting”). This way even relatively simple classifiers can be boosted to practically interesting accuracy levels
