we will learn how to build and train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using the MatConvNet framework. In particular, we will train several different CNNs for the recognition of handwritten digits (0-9) from 28×28 grayscale images.

We will build the network step-by-step demonstrating various techniques used nowadays as well as several caveats one should be aware of.

There are many resources available today for learning more about deep learning and CNNs in particular. You can find a few you may find interesting at the bottom of this page. However, hold on reading them all first. We will go slowly, adding one component after another and when you are finally set to do your own coding, you may want to revisit these links or find your own lectures, tutorials, videos, … We added links to relevant explanations into the text itself, so whenever you meet a new term, you can learn its meaning
